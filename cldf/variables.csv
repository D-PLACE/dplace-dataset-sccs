Incest taboos, if highly emphasized or widely extended, are considered as indicators of restraint. Note: Sexual nonrestraint = Sexual expression + 1 more or less. The authors indicate the advisability of using the sum of the two scores as a Sexual Freedom index.

Armed combat, which is fighting with weapons, is performed by military organizations. When political communities within the same cultural unit engage in warfare, this is considered to be internal war. p. 143: If there is more than one military organization within a political community, and these ... engage in armed combat, this is considered feuding or civil war, depending on the scope of the conflict.
